        Growing up in New York City, Jose started his career working as a
        bike messenger, which allowed him to meet a variety of people, that then 
        inspired him to work on his future and his passion, but just like any other
        16 year old, he didn’t know where to start. As his search began, he
        looked back to his love for cars and motorcycles and how he could relate
        that to technology.{' '}

      <p>
        Jose wasn’t a top notch mechanic, especially with YouTube and Google as
        his main tool, but he knew the responsibility of an engine is the same
        as it is with networks. Technology can work without a network, but what
        is tech without the power of the internet? So from being a mechanic, he
        decided to venture out and work on one of the most important pieces of
        technology, networks.{' '}

        Graduating from DeVry University, he earned his degree in Network
        Communications and Management, where he learned how to build and
        maintain network systems with Cisco routers and switches. Before he
        could step into the industry of networking, he learned about programming
        and engineering, and realized that there wasn’t much creativity with
        building and maintaining networks. Since then, he has connected with
        people in the community and learned what challenges they faced on a
        daily basis. This intrigued him so much that he began collaborating on a
        few projects and then ventured out into the world of programming and
        development.{' '}
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Jose began using resources like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and
        TeamTreehouse. He loves problem solving, being creative and seeing
        people happy with his work. After finding some projects to work on from
        friends, he met a real software engineer and had to collaborate on a
        project together. He noticed that he was lacking a lot of skills that
        were needed in today’s industry, so instead of ending up in tutorial
        hell, he went to a bootcamp.{' '}

      <p>
        Hack Reactor took him in and helped him gain the skills he needed to be
        a better engineer . He was able to find out his weaknesses and strengths
        and how to apply them to any team or project he is currently working on.
        Till this day, Jose is committed to being the best he can be, one line
        of code at a time.{' '}
